# Style Transfer of Informal style sentences to Formal style

## About
This is our Final Year [Project report](https://github.com/ACprime96/Style_Transfer_Informal_to_Formal) submitted to the [*Department of Information Science & Engineering*](msrit.edu/department/ise.html), <br />

#### Course code : IS821 SENIOR PROJECT

## Problem Statement

   In this project, we aim to translate a given sentence in an informal style to a more formal style using Neural Machine Translation.
## Applications
With the ever-increasing usage of social media, people tend to develop writing skills which are very skewed towards the informal style and they often find it really difficult to express things in a formal setting. Our tool can be used to tackle the above problem where users can improve their writing style to deliver content in a professional tone.
