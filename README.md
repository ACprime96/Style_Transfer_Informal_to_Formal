# Style Transfer of Informal style sentences to Formal style

## Problem Statement

   In this project, I translated a given sentence in an informal style to a more formal style using **Neural Machine Translation**. I used this project to improve my knowledge in the field of Machine translation
## Applications
With the ever-increasing usage of social media, people tend to develop writing skills which are very skewed towards the informal style and they often find it really difficult to express things in a formal setting. Our tool can be used to tackle the above problem where users can improve their writing style to deliver content in a professional tone.
